# Factory Design Pattern

Implementation of Factory Design Pattern    

Factory Method Pattern (Creational Pattern):
<ul>
  <li>Intent: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.</li>
</ul>

Applicability: Use it when:
<ul>
  <li>A class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create.</li>
<li> A class wants its subclass to specify the objects it creates. </li>
</ul>

# Singleton Design Pattern
Implementation of Singleton design pattern.

## How does it work?

Record class is a java class that should have only instance of the class. Applying the singleton design pattern to this class, will make it work.
When the main method is run for the first time, a text file called record.txt should get created contain-ing two lines as follows:     
    
Currently the file record.txt contains the following lines:     
Hello-1     
Hello-2     

When the main method is run again, the file record.txt should have two more lines appended. There-fore, the file then should contain the following lines as follows:

Currently the file record.txt contains the following lines:      
Hello-1      
Hello-2     
Hello-1      
Hello-2      

Thus, every run should append the two lines to the record.txt file. And, consequently the console out-put changes.

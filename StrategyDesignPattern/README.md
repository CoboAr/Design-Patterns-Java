# Strategy Design Pattern

Implementation of Strategy Design Pattern    

Strategy Pattern (Behavioral Pattern):   
<ul>
  <li>Intent : Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one and make them interchangeable. Strategy let the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.</li>
  <li>Motivation: Favours composition over inheritace; Encapsulates what varies.</li>
</ul>

## How does it work?    
Example:    
Instagram: Free photo sharing program.       
Principle: application should allow you to take pictures, apply a digital filter
(Emboss, Blur, MyFilter, â€¦), then share it with other Instagram users or upload
picture to my favorite social networking site.
The filter functionality should be implemented with strategy design pattern so that different kinds of filters can be applied to a picture ?
